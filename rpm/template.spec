%description
The package cob_canopen_motor implements a controller-drive component which is
connected to a can-bus and works with a canopen-interface.
&quot;CanDriveItf&quot; provides a - more or less - generic interface to the
controller-drive components. &quot;CanDrvie...&quot; then implements a specific
setup, e.g. an ELMO Harmonica Controller in case of the
&quot;CanDriveHarmonica&quot;.
